The motivation of the project is to develop an open source software solution, which will automate the blood counting process, which at the moment is carried out in laboratories worldwide either using the 'automated hematology counter' or manually.

This will be a software application that can recognize and count blood cells and create a standard full blood count report. Application will take a microscopic image as input and by using the techniques of image processing, computer vision and artificial intelligence, it will recognize the relevant cell type and count those that are in the image. In addition, this will be a web service where remote users can upload images and get the blood count online.
